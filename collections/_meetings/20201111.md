# DIALS meeting 2020-11-11

### Azure testing
Azure caching is completely broken, we've disabled caching and multi-python builds for now. Pull requests that aren't based on a recent `master` may have failing builds. Merge `master` into them to fix.

### [dials#1484: spotfinding cleanups](https://github.com/dials/dials/issues/1484)
* Shouldn't be controversial.
* **AP:** GW to test locally and approve

### [dials#1029: dials.index: keep input experiments and extend list](https://github.com/dials/dials/issues/1029)
* RG: Although there are no specific objections there is an appreciation that this will break *everything*.
* Specific use case is anything with large number of experiments and you then want to go back to indexing later
* Analogy: In indexing we don't throw away unindexed reflections
* DGW: I think it will work. It probably will break things, but those can be changed. In principle this sounds reasonable.
* **Outcome:** Cautious support for the principle.

### [dials#1441: Set `nproc=auto` by default for spot-finding and integration](https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/1441)
* ND: If we add nproc=auto then we bog down the test machine
* MG: If we use nproc=1 in tests we run a different code path to users.
* GW: Should possibly set nproc=2 in tests to avoid the code path issue.
* RG: It will make dials easier to run for the user
* **Outcome:** Merge, if there are any problems then we'll address that in the future.

### dxtbx Nexus format support
* Nexus files generated at Diamond do follow the Nexus spec.
* dxtbx makes parsing correct nexus files hard, as there are too many different nearlybutnotquite-formats that try to jump in with broken geometry assumptions etc.
* **AP:** BW to follow up
* https://manual.nexusformat.org/utilities.html#language-api-python

### Reflection matching
* https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/1398#issuecomment-690123149 last on this topic - guess probably couple hours work needed?

### Adding GEMMI as dependency of DIALS
Would be useful for xia2 mmcif stuff?

* https://github.com/dials/dials/issues/1266
* MG: Would hold back on this until the conda-forge package is fixed: https://github.com/conda-forge/gemmi-feedstock/issues/20
* **AP:** DW to follow up
 
### Not discussed in this meeting
* @James B-E you had something to pick up re: anomalous signal (presence or absence thereof?)
* Outcomes from last collaboration call with RJR etc.
