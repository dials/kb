#### LFM / DGW

* `dials.scale`
* `dials.refine`
* `dials.index`

We should open this up to our collaborators

#### possible future topics

* DIALS tutorial (command line): ND?
* xia2 tutorial
* DUI tutorial: Luiso
* `dials.scale`: JBE
* `dials.refine`: DGW
* DIALS for multi-crystal: RJG
    * `dials.cosym`, `xia2.multiplex`, etc.
* DIALS for small molecule: BW
    * `screen19`, `xia2`
* DIALS for beamlines
    * dxtbx formats, PIA, DLS infrastructure
* DIALS as a toolbox
* DIALS for stills:
    * xfel: ASB
    * synchrotron: User? Danny/Pierre?
* DIALS probably should have a YouTube channel

* [Avoid passing phil params object to library functions in export/merging](https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/1339)
    * RG to look at it today
* [a DIALS installer script #1198](https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/1198) 
    * MG: waiting on discussion with ND in a DIALS core meeting, as it is entirely dependent on where we want to go with conda.
* [No more abc #1365](https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/1365)
    * discussed, can be merged, maybe RG to look at?
* [Move not copy data from imageset_ext #199](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/199)
    * discussed, can be merged
* [Cast to `numpy.string_` for comparison #190](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/190)
    * discussed, can be merged
* [Fix mask pointers: get_mask -> get_static_mask #198](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/198)
    * RG reviewed

### GW:
* sort out [https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/1075](https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/1075) e.g. useful title, rebase, decide what this should be doing / good for
* [Trap bad cb_op in dials.reindex #1282](https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/1282)

### Help Wanted:
* [Proper detector geometry for NeXus files #206](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/206)


### dxtbx cleanup
_Maybe_ we should do some housekeeping of _all_ format classes :arrow_right: issue (i.e. we should limit classes to ones which _end users_ will use without specialist environment e.g. from dials release)

## 3. DIALS 3.1 release
* ND is not present
* Release due in ~2 weeks
* Consider slowing down major breaking changes on `master`
* Currently no major issues tagged with 3.1 release
* Will have a core meeting between now and then
* I23 / edge-of-detector-panel integration fixes from RG
    * [Most reflections not integrated on i23 detector #1291](https://github.com/dials/dials/issues/1291)
    * [Be more permissive in profile fitting #1297](https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/1297)

## 4. NeXus support

* no enthusiasm from people to engage with this

## 5. Other stuff
* News from CCP4:
    * i2 has a qt5 branch, next release may go that way. This would make life easier for DUI (eg. lattice viewer within DUI)
    * next release may be Python 3
    * DUI needs porting to Python 3
    * DUI :arrow_right: conda-forge - MG volunteers to assist
    * time line approx. 5 months
* DIALS now has a gitter channel at [https://gitter.im/dials/community](https://gitter.im/dials/community)
* GW should probably dig out fp3 - needs effort on adding parallelism - should present what this is
* Some discussion of why we do all the profile modelling in one go?
* Scan varying profile models in there, worked but was issues? Rediscover this. 
* TODO dig out the happy / sad face review on how-we-doing-in-dials
* publish these minutes on [https://dials.github.io/kb/](https://dials.github.io/kb/)
