    - [ ] Nick: Outstanding issues with dispatcher re-export on windows
    - [ ] This is a higher priority now - David feeling pain of missing
    - [ ] Also, seeing related errors "in the wild" e.g. [`cctbx/dxtbx#434`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/434)
- [ ] Removal of DataBlock [[prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210909#datablock), [prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210826#removal-of-datablock)]
    - [ ] **Nick:** More visible deprecationwarning
    - [ ] Impact assessment to see what/who is affected
        - [ ] Other repositories - stuff like, iota, prime, ls49, labelit, labelit-regression, xfel-regression, lunus, uc_metrics gitlab/cctbx*, phenix and phenix_regression (phenix.image_viewer)
- DXTBX/pycbf [[prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210826#cbflib-conda-forge-packagepycbf)]
    - Outstanding: [`dxtbx#368`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/368) for optional cbflib/_adaptbx .
    * [ ] ND: conda-forge pycbf: Make new release to use dials-data directly for tests
    * [ ] Last status: one `labelit`/`labelit_regression` test still doesn't pass
    * All except one labelit tests are now working. On NKS todo list to fix.
    * Progress on CBFlib 0.9.7?
- [ ] Nonconventional P1 indexing [[prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210923#nonconventional-p1-indexing)]
    - [ ] [`dials/dials#1880`](https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/1880)
    - [ ] Possible numeric instabilities remaining in e.g. `minimum_cell`
    - [ ] **RG:** Going to look into this at some point
- [ ] Deterministic Experiment Identifiers [[prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210923#deterministic-experiment-identifiers)]
    - [ ] **Aaron:** Change `dials.stills_process` to default to composite mode and not write experiment files
    - [ ] **GW/Aaron**: Organise another meeting to go over ["load before heat death"](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/118) PR and reasons why, solutions etc


## Agenda

### Deterministic Experiment Identifiers

- ([Previous dicussion](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210923#deterministic-experiment-identifiers), original PR: [`dials/dials#1864`](https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/1864))
- Previously discussed reasons for request and what data was trying to be tracked
- discussed how `ImageSequence` might work around the exact problems
- 9th November GW/AB 8am PST meeting

### Contiguous Nexus

- [ ] "Contiguous Nexus" [`cctbx/dxtbx#356`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/356)
    - [ ] Non-draft state is pending checks against issues @dwpaley raised, and checking for non-contiguous cases [[prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210715#contiguous-nexus-pr)]
- AB wants this to be applied against new nexus writing
- RG: Probably useful to mock up an example in the nxmxtests
- Probably useful to reduce down zenodo dataset used in the issue ([`cctbx/dxtbx#93`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/issues/93))

### FormatSMVADSCSN442 timing

- [`cctbx/dxtbx#445`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/445)
- ND: We will look at tomorrow and either merge or propose replacement

### üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è DX2 üßü‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Came up in discussion about new image viewers for NX the need for e.g. dxpy which would be a limited-dependency API for reading MX images (e.g. to numpy arrays)

* [ ] Shelve and come back in three months, see what everyone's time looks like
* [ ] [dx2 proposal](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210128#dx2-proposal)
	* [ ] ~~MG to put in a PR to create a proposal in the proposal-space~~
    * [ ] ~~MG+ND: Come up with a proposal to [move away from all code being in header files](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20201001#overall-architecture-discussion) and consolidate into a single library~~
- We collectively agree that this is not going to come to pass

### Removal of DataBlock

### ImageSet/ImageSetData memory usage

- [`cctbx/dxtbx#438`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/438)
