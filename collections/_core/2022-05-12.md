- [ ] ND to review: TOFBeam - A time-of-flight beam in dxtbx [`cctbx/dxtbx#492`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/492) ([prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20220303#proposal-for-a-time-of-flight-beam-in-dxtbx))
- [ ] `std::string` support for messagepack. This is used in XFEL module, should try to fix. [`dials/dials#1858`](https://github.com/dials/dials/issues/1858).


## Agenda


### DXTBX read-only base

- Issue [`cctbx/dxtbx#444`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/issues/444)
- Read only base by default would be the ideal
- Previously discussed downstream use cases and if DIALS needs to be included
- ~~Reopened under [`cctbx/dxtbx#511`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/511) - main change is regenerating dispatcher immediately during configuration, this mostly seems to work~~ merged
- Last time AB: going to run in next few days
- Can we close this out now?
  - Yes!

### Contiguous Nexus

- [ ] "Contiguous Nexus" [`cctbx/dxtbx#356`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/356)
    - [ ] Non-draft state is pending checks against issues @dwpaley raised, and checking for non-contiguous cases [[prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210715#contiguous-nexus-pr)]
- AB wants this to be applied against new nexus writing
- RG: Probably useful to mock up an example in the nxmxtests
- **Action: Aaron** Reduce down zenodo dataset used in the issue ([`cctbx/dxtbx#93`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/issues/93))
 so that we can include it in dials-data.
- Afterward: Coordinate with RG to make sure the ideas in this are integrated into new nexus reading
- WIP - Dan has reduced to Six images - 300mb, wondering if this is enough. Discussion about what is required for the files and how small to absorb into the dials-data repository.
- Close thread until the new NeXus stuff is merged then we can reopen it? Yeh
- GW to help DP with some "nasty h5py scripts" to make ensmallen data

### Dropping Data Blocks

https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/504

- [x] GW PR
 - [ ] After PR/PRs, ASB to contact e.g. Mike Wall about this, too. 
 - GW thinks reasonable to merge when these concerns addressed
 - Waiting on AB now, will get sorted as soon as can

### AOB
 - dxtbx#517 - with the except exception in it ðŸ˜± - has numpy magic in it - GW suggested Ben to have a look at as it contains much numpy - pls can add logging around the except exception
 - dials/data-files#42 new file PR
