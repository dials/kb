# DIALS core meeting 2025-01-16

## Previous Actions

- [ ] **ND** Investigate getting `psana` tests running on the DIALS xfel-regression testing
- [ ] **ND**: Move dials.diamond.ac.uk to a redirect to dials.github.io
- [x] **ND**: Please add Central US time to meeting time on agenda.

## Agenda

### Python 3.10 and psana
- psana repo: https://github.com/lcls-psana/psana
- cctbx environment for running: https://github.com/cctbx/cctbx_project/tree/master/xfel/conda_envs
- Azure yml: https://github.com/cctbx/cctbx_project/blob/master/.azure-pipelines/xfel/unix-psana-build.yml
- Request to build on anaconda channel lcls-i have been made, undetermined timescales before this is built for python 3.10
- Wait until 3.10 version is available, add to xfel-regression tests, then address long-term situation.

### Aaron dials web-page PRs
- Aaron wants link to slack channel on webpage
    - Link on front of DIALS README still works, should add this
    - [ ] **ND**: Action: Replace dials-support link with slack link

### General README overhaul
- New grants not listed!
    - Probably an Aaron action
- README somewhat crusty and out of date
- Contact link to slack should be more prominent


### Github Actions
- Aaron would still like to have a walkthrough of new actions scripts at some point
- XFEL-regression has had issues appear with MPI backend
    - Seems to be related to https://github.com/conda-forge/openmpi-feedstock/issues/185
    - Believe these are solved now


### MCD Outlier Rejection
Previous:
- AB PR: https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/2676
- Relatively happy with, touches xia2.ssx so wanted JBE to look over
- Adds lots of new settings, does not change current defaults but thinks it should do
- ~~JBE will have a look at it~~
    - JBE Has had a look! Has feedback/suggestions https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/2750
    - AB will have a look


### "Add the ellipsoid profile model as an option in dials.stills_process"
- https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/2615
- Status: waiting on Aaron to review, not pressing so likely not in immediate future.

### Collaboration Meeting?!

- Graeme requested to add
 - AB: Dials workshop in association with a user meeting? Two days workshop two days DIALS perhaps? Discuss!
- [ ] **GW**: Kick off conversation in dials-support about this
