* [x] MG: Giving a [typing intro lecture](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/2020917#typing-mypy) on 14th of July, 13:00 BST
* [ ] ND: conda-forge pycbf: Make new release to use dials-data directly for tests
- [ ] "Contiguous Nexus" [`cctbx/dxtbx#356`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/356)
    - [ ] Non-draft state is pending checks against issues @dwpaley raised, and checking for non-contiguous cases [[prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210715#contiguous-nexus-pr)]
- [ ] dxtbx `src/` layout [[prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210715#src-layout-for-dxtbx)]
    - [ ] **Action**: Ask cctbxbb if anyone has knowledge or experience of re-export of dispatchers on windows
- [ ] Nonconventional P1 indexing [[prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210715#nonconventional-p1-indexing)] - a possible problem with indexing nonstandard settings in P1
    - [ ] **Action**: Dan to try and demonstrate this on a simple/lysozyme example and file an issue

## Agenda

### dxtbx `src/` layout

- Aaron has feedback from Billy; Two issues with current src/ layout
    - Modifies the `conda-base` folder - this is causing the windows problems
    - pip install fails on supercomputer bases when you cannot alter the base python that are read only
    - `pip install --no-deps -e` apparently contacts the internet - cannot do on 
    - Until fixed will probably pin dials
    - All this applies to xia2 also

### Mirror when stable
- Action occasionally fails - even when everything else passes - e.g. dff4fc1
- Sends an email to developer of most recent commit

### [cbflib conda-forge package/pycbf](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210520#cbflib-conda-forge-package)

* Outstanding: [dxtbx#368](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/368) for optional usage in dxtbx, no binary dependence on cbflib/_adaptbx if present.
    * Still stray issue with dataset `SPring8_ADSC_SN916` being the only one requiring `FormatCBFFull`. One possible solution is adding a special Format: [`dials/dials#366`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/366)
* Still need to test with `labelit`/`labelit_regression` once the test suites actually work
    * All except one labelit tests are now working. On NKS todo list to fix.
* Progress on CBFlib 0.9.7?
    * No progress. HB probably busy with ACA.

### flumpy -- flex/numpy bridge
- ~~Additional problem: [`cctbx/dxtbx#398`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/issues/398) `from_numpy` currently fails if `scitbx.array_family.flex` has not already been imported.~~ import fixed
- Additional issues seen:
    - [`cctbx/dxtbx#406`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/issues/406) -Converting numpy arrays that don't own their own data
    - [`cctbx/dxtbx#405`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/issues/405) - Converting non-contiguous numpy arrays
        - ~~scitbx arrays appears to have origin property that could be used for this?~~ doesn't appear possible. Throw helpful errors.


### Next meeting
Thursday, August 12th, 4pm UK (BST), 8am PDT.
