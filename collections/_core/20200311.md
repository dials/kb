## Agenda

### dxtbx comparator pseudo-classes
[dxtbx#302](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/302#issuecomment-778230823) found dxtbx comparator classes in `dxtbx.datablock`. These classes (`SequenceDiff`, `BeamDiff`, `ScanDiff`, `GoniometerDiff`, `DetectorDiff`) should really be functions. Given they are in datablock they could move to `dxtbx.model.experiment_list`, but possibly something like `dxtbx.model.compare` makes more sense?

(This is independent of [dxtbx#288](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/288) above)

**AP:** GW to add comment to that PR, rediscuss when ASB is present.


### Next meeting
Thursday, March 25th, 4pm UK time, 8am PDT.
