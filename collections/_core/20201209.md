    * [ ] MG+ND: Come up with a proposal to [move away from all code being in header files](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20201001) and consolidate into a single library
    * [ ] ND: [to review xia2 DC1](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20201125#xia2-dc1) ([#528](https://github.com/xia2/xia2/pull/528))
* [ ] ND: update `CONTRIBUTING` in a (separate) pull request to include a soft-imposition of [stable master](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20200903), [dials#1353](https://github.com/dials/dials/issues/1353).
* [ ] MG: organise a [typing intro lecture](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20200917).

    * [ ] ND to set up an agenda for a code-review meeting
    * [ ] then: ASB to set up a meeting with HJB, BKP, ASB, ND
    * [ ] ASB to explore what should happen to cbflib maintenance in the future
* [ ] [`cbflib_adaptbx` dependency](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20201125#cbflib_adaptbx-dependency)
    * [ ] ND to set up a pull request for MAR detector fixes. Verify with labelit_regression.

## Agenda

**This meeting instance is ring-fenced to discuss pull requests with the word 'range' and/or 'lazy' in the subject, and performance issues baked into dxtbx.**

### Definition of `trusted_range`

Discuss PR [Definition of `trusted_range` (dxtbx#182)](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/issues/182)


### `image_range` vs. `array_range` baked in off-by-one errors

Discuss [`image_range` vs. `array_range` baked in off-by-one errors (dxtbx#186)](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/issues/186)
* DW made a proposal and started work on that, but it proved messy
* There is a new, simpler, proposal but this version kills off the `image_range` concept rather than `array_range`
* Discuss, again, what we want here and whether the new proposal is useful


### dxtbx json/msgpack performance

ASB reports json being problematic when importing e.g. 50,000 experiments, as everything is stored in a single file, so everything needs to be read at once.

* GW: cf. [Load before heat death (dxtbx#118)](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/118). At the core of it are bad design choices in dxtbx.
* Future discussion topics:
    1. treatment of large serial datasets
    2. using an HDF5 backend for reflection files
    3. [dials#1407](https://github.com/dials/dials/issues/1407) specific proposal
* ASB: I want `check_format` to go away.

Previous discussion outcomes:

* ASB:
    * General consensus that this is needed.
    * Make models and store them
    * Load them in parallel with minimal memory requirements
    * Version all models and rewind them
        * This needs a lot of thought and at this time we don't have agreement here.
    * Not need to copy data like shoeboxes when they aren't being changed, operate by reference


### renaming `master` branch â†’ `main`
*not discussed in this meeting*

* Nothing much will happen on this any time soon - either way we'll [wait for GitHub support on this one](https://github.com/github/renaming)
* General assent that this is useful
* since 1st of October new GitHub repositories have `main` as the default
* **proposed outcome**: Agree to migrate to `main`. Turn this into dxtbx/dials/xia2 issues and move once GitHub provides a migration path. Use xia2 as a test-bed and move dials and dxtbx two weeks later.


### DIALS documentation build
*not discussed in this meeting*

Should the DIALS documentation build outside a cctbx environment?

* Currently you can only build the DIALS documentation inside a cctbx environment. This means a remote documentation build needs to build cctbx first, so we can't easily run the documentation build on every commit. When things break they are difficult to fix. We can't use readthedocs.
* MG: I believe the main obstacles are three cctbx Sphinx plugins that may need to be extracted or removed from DIALS documentation, and some phil parsing logic.
    * MG: the cctbx conda-forge package may be useful here


### move the active `dxtbx` repository into the DIALS organisation
*not discussed in this meeting*

Having the main repository in cctbx_project has a few distinct disadvantages. The most annoying is the [eternal fight against the lockdown bot](https://github.com/dials/dxtbx/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+-label%3Aupcoming-release+), but we also don't get LGTM output.

* **proposed outcome**: move the active `dxtbx` repository into the DIALS organisation. Do it in such a way that the impact on existing installations, issues, pull requests is minimal.

### dials.index: create new experiments
*not discussed in this meeting*

dials.index should (or should not) create new experiments with crystals in rather than modifying in place existing experiments [as proposed in this issue](https://github.com/dials/dials/issues/1029)
