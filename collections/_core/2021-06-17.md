	* [ ] MG to put in a PR to create a proposal in the proposal-space
    * [ ] MG+ND: Come up with a proposal to [move away from all code being in header files](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20201001#overall-architecture-discussion) and consolidate into a single library
- cbflib conda-forge/pycbf packaging
    - [ ] Aaron: Look into labelit regression tests
    - [X] MG: Add HJB as repository owner
- [x] DIALS deprecations
    - [X] [`cctbx/dxtbx#371`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/371) can go in
    - [X] `xtc_process` needs minor work before [`dials/dials#1731`](https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/1731)
- [X] Accept [DC-3](https://dials.github.io/kb/proposals/dc3) to follow [NEP-29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html)
    - Python 3.6 will be supported on development branch until DIALS 3.6.0 is released, at which point 3.7 will become the minimum supported version of python.
    - Python 3.7 will be dropped on Dec 26, 2021, which means that DIALS 3.8.* will be the last release to support Python 3.7 as a minimum.
- [X] Delete `master` branches from dials/dxtbx
- [X] Switch to `hdf5plugin` as the HDF5 plugin provider 
    - [dxtbx#373](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/373) and [dials#1733](https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/1733) merged. Developers will have to update this manually.
- [X] scitbx flex "ABI" issue
    - resolved by conda-forge pulling package in question

## Agenda

### Azure tests broken on dxtbx/xia2 [Fixed]
- ~~[`cctbx/dxtbx#383`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/issues/383)~~ Merged.
- [`xia2/xia2#601`](https://github.com/xia2/xia2/issues/601) fix incoming via [`dials/dials#1752`](https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/1752)
- Cause is mismatch between cctbx in `modules/` and version in `conda_base/lib/python3.X/site-packages/` - having a second copy of cctbx_project appears to be limitation of libtbx build system\
- Look into adding check for version shear in libtbx.SConscript - Make ticket (**Action: Nick**)


### [cbflib conda-forge package/pycbf](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210520#cbflib-conda-forge-package)

* Version: 0.9.6.3 - fixes some distribution issues. .4 coming soon to use released [dials-data](https://github.com/dials/data/blob/master/dials_data/definitions/pycbf.yml) datasets
* [dxtbx#368](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/368) for optional usage in dxtbx, no binary dependence on cbflib/_adaptbx if present.
    * Still stray issue with dataset `SPring8_ADSC_SN916` being the only one requiring `FormatCBFFull`.
* Still need to test with `labelit`/`labelit_regression` once the test suites actually work
    * ~~GW needs to review~~ https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/369 (**merged**)
    * All except one labelit tests are now working. On NKS todo list to fix.


### Status checks before merging
We had two cases recently where pull requests were merged too eagerly ([dials#1699](https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/1699#issuecomment-847388092), [dials#1729](https://github.com/dials/dials/issues/1729)). We now have a status indicating build step. Should we set it so that the pull request build has to complete before merging? We can then also enable automatic merging once the build passes.

**Outcome:** Turn it on, and evaluate in a month.


### Update to Python 3.9 as default environment
[`dials#1735`](https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/1735) will make 3.9 the default for new environments. You can still pick 3.6 -- 3.8 by specifying a version manually.

**Outcome:** No objection to merging. Make it so.


### `src/` layout for dxtbx
[`cctbx/dxtbx#382`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/382), ~~currently blocked by https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/issues/383~~.
This is now affecting other people, [`dials/dials#1749`](https://github.com/dials/dials/issues/1749).

Outcome:
- Check cctbx bootstrap, xfel builder Check phenix builder (needs `--cci-user`)
- Check dials bootstrap builder
- Barring extra problems happy to make this change
- Migration for libtbx entry point case in `libtbx_refresh.py`
- Will need a developer *'this is how you update your environment'* bulletin


### Enable `pathlib` objects for dials-data 
[`dials/data#275`](https://github.com/dials/data/pull/275) will be merged soon. This deprecates the default `py.path` return objects, and adds an option to the dials-data fixture that allows returning `py.path` or `pathlib` objects.

(Currently blocked by [`xia2/xia2#597`](https://github.com/xia2/xia2/pull/597), which is blocked by [`cctbx/dxtbx#381`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/381), which is blocked by [`cctbx/dxtbx#383`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/issues/383))

**Outcome:** Make this happen once blockers are out of the way.


### flumpy -- flex/numpy bridge
- [`cctbx/dxtbx#377`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/377)
- Tests blocked by [`cctbx/cctbx_project@ab8949`](https://github.com/cctbx/cctbx_project/commit/ab8949cd765dd31ef8749a5b5950459ffdf35c36) making it into release (cctbx v2021.6)

Enthusiastically received.


### Next meeting
