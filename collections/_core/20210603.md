	* [ ] MG to put in a PR to create a proposal in the proposal-space

## Agenda


### DIALS deprecations
[`dials/dials#1731`](https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/1731) will need some work in `xtc_process` for [`MaskGenerator`](https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/1731#issuecomment-853942134).

[`cctbx/dxtbx#371`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/371) can go in.

### [cbflib conda-forge package/pycbf](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210520#cbflib-conda-forge-package)

* Version: 0.9.6.3 - fixes some distribution issues. .4 coming soon to use released [dials-data](https://github.com/dials/data/blob/master/dials_data/definitions/pycbf.yml) datasets (rather than a fork). Used a Zenodo source for MAR format (no changes to implementation)
* `conda install pycbf` also works now via conda-forge
* [dxtbx#368](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/368) still exists for optional usage in dxtbx, no binary dependence on cbflib/_adaptbx if present.
    * Still stray issue with dataset `SPring8_ADSC_SN916` being the only one requiring `FormatCBFFull`.
* [`dials/pycbf#19`](https://github.com/dials/pycbf/issues/19) HJB thread
    * 0.9.6 is "Obsolete"
    * 0.9.7 due late June
* Still need to test with `labelit`/`labelit_regression` once the test suites actually work
    * ~~GW needs to review~~ https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/369 (**merged**)
- **MG Action**: Add HJB as pycbf owner. MG: Invited.

### Python 3.6 Support
- Previously [discussed](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210520#python-36-support) proposal [DC-3](https://dials.github.io/kb/proposals/dc3) to move DIALS/dxtbx to [NEP-29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html)
- We needed an awareness of the Phenix support plan
- Any update on this?
- Phenix is going straight to 3.7 
- Okay to commit to this

### Delete `master` branches
We moved to `main` 3 months ago. Can the `master` branches be removed?
- Yes

### `hdf5plugin`
Pull requests have been made in [dxtbx#373](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/373) and [dials#1733](https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/1733).
Suggest existing developer installs update and remove the hdf-external-filter package manually.

- merge these

### Status checks before merging
We had two cases recently where pull requests were merged too eagerly ([dials#1699](https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/1699#issuecomment-847388092), [dials#1729](https://github.com/dials/dials/issues/1729)). We now have a status indicating build step. Should we set it so that the pull request build has to complete before merging? We can then also enable automatic merging once the build passes.

### `scitbx.flex` ABI shift problem

[`cctbx#616`](https://github.com/cctbx/cctbx_project/pull/616)

## Deferred to next meeting


### Next meeting
Thursday, June 17th, 4pm UK (BST), 8am PDT.
