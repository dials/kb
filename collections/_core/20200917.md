## Agenda

In this meeting we will only discuss the agenda items `Typing` and `dxtbx json/msgpack performance`.

### Typing
Options:
* [mypy pre-commit, mypy action (#1357)](https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/1357)
* [pytype action (#1364)](https://github.com/dials/dials/issues/1364)

What do we want to do?

### dxtbx json/msgpack performance
ASB reports json being problematic when importing e.g. 50,000 experiments, as everything is stored in a single file, so everything needs to be read at once.

* GW: cf. [Load before heat death (dxtbx#118)](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/118). At the core of it are bad design choices in dxtbx.
* Future discussion topics:
    1. treatment of large serial datasets
    2. using an HDF5 backend for reflection files
    3. [dials#1407](https://github.com/dials/dials/issues/1407) specific proposal
* ASB: I want `check_format` to go away.
* GW: discuss in a separate meeting early US, late UK time

### DIALS documentation build
*(to be discussed in the following meeting)*

Should the DIALS documentation build outside a cctbx environment?

* Currently you can only build the DIALS documentation inside a cctbx environment. This means a remote documentation build needs to build cctbx first, so we can't easily run the documentation build on every commit. When things break they are difficult to fix. We can't use readthedocs.
* MG: I believe the main obstacles are three cctbx Sphinx plugins that may need to be extracted or removed from DIALS documentation, and some phil parsing logic.

### renaming `master` branch â†’ `main`
*(to be discussed in the following meeting)*

* Nothing much will happen on this any time soon - either way we'll [wait for GitHub support on this one](https://github.com/github/renaming)
* General assent that this is useful
* from 1st of October new GitHub repositories will have `main` as the default
* MG: Suggest turning this into an issue and removing from agenda until GitHub provides a migration path for existing repositories.

### `cbflib_adaptbx` dependency
*(to be discussed in the following meeting)*

We are only referencing `compress` and `uncompress` functions, and `cbflib_adaptbx` has a MSVC-ancient-dependency. We could copy the functions into `dxtbx_ext` and remove the dependency.

### Any other business
*(to be discussed in the following meeting)*

### Next meeting

October 1st, 4pm UK time, 8am PDT.
