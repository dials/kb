# DIALS core meeting 2023-02-23

## Previous Actions

- [ ] `std::string` support for messagepack. This is used in XFEL module, should try to fix. [`dials/dials#1858`](https://github.com/dials/dials/issues/1858).
    - [X] Is using pickle until this is fixed, so probably good to do
    - [X] AB Added to codecamp list. Might get to this!
    - [X] Looking at this week. Removing seems acceptable and probably the easiest solution
    - [ ] **ND Action**: PR to remove from dials code
- [ ] **ND** Investigate getting `psana` tests running on the DIALS xfel-regression testing
- [x] **ND**: Unpin setuptools in DIALS builds
- [ ] Dropping Data Blocks ([#504](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/504))
    - [x] **Action**: DGW WIP migrating data to dials-data
- [ ] **ND**: Squash rampage on repositories
- [ ] **GW**: Audit dxtbx/dials for `deepcopy` calls to make sure they are sensible


## Agenda

### CBFlib

- HJB Working on 0.9.8 release
- Discussion about making a thread to co-ordinate what it would take to move dials directly back to cbflib


### AOB?


### Detector dxtbx.plot_detector_models fixes

- https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/610
- Aaron going to look at offline
- Some uncertainty over what has gone wrong

### Handle Blank IDs

https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/2342

- Discussion over all/any

### Reflection table performance tuning

https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/2129

- Agreed that a different approach should be used

### Issue: Slicing reflection tables drops identifier map

https://github.com/dials/dials/issues/2276

- Would be very useful to fix

### Make ScanBase polymorphic

https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/503

- Issue: Having `get_wavelength` fail for polychromatic wavelength makes sense - however use cases have partially monochromatic changes, which this fails.
- Seems to be agreement to close this, and there will be new PRs to get this stuff in next month.
- Discussion over possible links of this to the beam Spectrum clases.
- Closing this PR, more PRs will be created when merging work begins in earnest.

### Moving flex tables from dials to dxtbx

https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/2113

- Comments on deprecation instead of direct removal
- **Action**: Solve deprecation issue and merge conflicts, discuss next time.

### Code camp idea?

- Aaaron suggests - a few days, couple of hours a day, work on outstanding smaller issues?
- Discuss next time








### Next meeting

Thursday, March 9th, 4pm (GMT), 8am (PST)
