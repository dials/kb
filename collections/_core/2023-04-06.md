## Agenda

### Moving flex tables from dials to dxtbx

https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/2113

- Previously discussed deprecation instead of direct removal
    - This work appears to have been done by DM
- Had planned to re-discuss at next meeting
- Discussion about what is actually being moved/deprecated
    - `flex_table` specifically is moved, but `reflection_table` is staying in DIALS as-is
    - ND plans to merge next week after the DIALS release

### Code camp idea?

- Aaron suggests - a few days, couple of hours a day, work on outstanding smaller issues?
- Virtual DIALS code-camp
- Split into sessions:
    - Planning
    - Coding
    - Closeout
- Graeme suggests linking to potential serial workshop being talked about at Cornell/CHESS for ~end of July
    - Initial plans for Week of 17th July, unconfirmed


### NX Writer! ([prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/2023-03-09#aob))

- Did some scan-related work last time
