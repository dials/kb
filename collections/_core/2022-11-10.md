# DIALS core meeting 2022-11-10

## Previous Actions

- [ ] `std::string` support for messagepack. This is used in XFEL module, should try to fix. [`dials/dials#1858`](https://github.com/dials/dials/issues/1858).
    - [ ] Is using pickle until this is fixed, so probably good to do
    - [ ] AB Added to codecamp list. Might get to this!
    - [ ] Looking at this week. Removing seems acceptable and probably the easiest solution
- [x] **AB**: Complete coordinate updates (Fix beam center and intensity readout of pixel coordinates)
- [ ] https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/issues/559
    - [x] **GW**: Checks to see what  affects.
    - [ ] **AB**: Make PR for above
- [ ] **Nick** Investigate getting `psana` tests running on the DIALS xfel-regression testing
- [ ] **GW**: https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/issues/562 - create a one-page summary on projecting resolution rings onto a matplotlib image
- [ ] **ND**: Unpin setuptools in DIALS builds

## Agenda

### TOFBeam
- AB Met with DmD and Laue-interested groups and was impressed by work
- Derived new classes from the refiner!
- January for resubmitting these to DIALS
- **Action**: Have meeting about this in new year, want to work out strategy for getting in ASAP in new year

### LBL Codecamp
- Got to lots of small improvements
    - cctbx-XFEL testing
    - Beam center /intensity readout issues
    - NXmx equipment components
    - Contiguous Nexus (redndant slicing PR)
    - Reflection subsampling in stills_process


### Dropping Data Blocks

https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/504

- [x] GW PR
 - [x] After PR/PRs, ASB to contact e.g. Mike Wall about this, too. 
 - GW thinks reasonable to merge when these concerns addressed
 - Waiting on AB now, will get sorted as soon as can
- Progress!
    - DataBlock in Lunus is one of the outstanding issues
        - AB Identified scripts, Mike Wall agreed that they should be deprecated
        - **This is Done!** Was entirely in deprecated scripts that weren't being used any more
    - XFEL repos are still WIP
        - [ls49](https://github.com/nksauter/LS49)
        - [cxid9114](https://github.com/dermen/cxid9114) (this should be fixed)
- Planned time to work on this stuff in October
- [ ] [Just after branch for 3.12 release of DIALS merge this](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/504#issuecomment-1289068097)
- Did this! However... this broke a lot. We reverted and made again, but a bit more complete.
- Currently actively being worked on

### Stills to sequences

https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/2273
- dials.import convert_stills_to_sequences=True broken for h5 data - several github issues relating to this (see PR above for links)
- With current dxtbx code, PR does not work for formats that include lazy formats (e.g. SACLA test data), due to an assertion in FormatMultiImage.py: https://github.com/dials/dxtbx/blob/7494dc0332f94c0d4593865f82c7c08a88ae65ea/src/dxtbx/format/FormatMultiImage.py#L215 What is the rationale behind this assertion (developer warning/sanity check?), can it be removed (seems to work fine if removed)?
- Everyone go and reaffirm their understandings and find out what the real reasons/solutions could be

#### NXMX Python

https://github.com/dials/nxmx

- Important to be able to work on/modify directly in a bootstrap environment, make sure that this can be added as a likewise dependency
- Nexpy?

### AOB?


### Logging

- **ND:** Look at https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/2263

### RANSAC Indexing

- https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/2275
- Planning to merge soon
- Brief discussion on whether this should be added to main dials.index


### Next meeting

Thursday, November 24th, 4pm (GMT), 8am (PST)
