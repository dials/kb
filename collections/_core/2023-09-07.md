## Agenda



### dials.stills_process refactor
- Made much more efficient when having mixed image sizes so that each rank doesn't need to do all the import itself
- still WIP


### SerialTBX status update ([prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/2023-06-15#removing-circular-xfel-dependencies-with-serialtbx)).
- **AB**: Moving forward serialtbx changes 
- [cctbx#872](https://github.com/cctbx/cctbx_project/pull/872) now marked ready for review
    - Awaiting NKS approval
    - dxtbx will break
        - We can use cctbx nightly for dxtbx/dials tests
        - should we do this longer-term?
            - **ND**: Investigate making this stable (e.g. cctbx tests) longer term

### DIALS-support "Error importing .cbf files using DIALS"
- [dials#2488](https://github.com/dials/dials/issues/2488)
-  Pilatus3 1M at BL02B1, SPRING-8 appears to be transposed!!??!?
- Graeme got some info from Kunio, Takanori seems to be looking at
- Seems to be no explanation for the very odd inverted-detector behaviour
    - Done for Crysalis convention
    - Takanori appears to have Format class in hand
    - Okay to ignore the exceptionally different files as no timestamp and no longer generated



### dials.cosym finds the right operator but puts it wrongly
- [dials#2486](https://github.com/dials/dials/issues/2486)
- DP will try to have a look on Monday
