## Agenda

### New flake8 pre-commit checks
* [`DIALS#1764`](https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/1764)
* **Action:** ND to merge


### libtbx version shear
* Look into adding check for version shear in libtbx.SConscript 
* Will leave as is. We do not encourage use of prebuilt-cctbx in developer installations for reasons such as this


### [cbflib conda-forge package/pycbf](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210520#cbflib-conda-forge-package)

* Version: 0.9.6.3 - fixes some distribution issues. .4 coming soon to use released [dials-data](https://github.com/dials/data/blob/master/dials_data/definitions/pycbf.yml) datasets
* [dxtbx#368](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/368) for optional usage in dxtbx, no binary dependence on cbflib/_adaptbx if present.
    * Still stray issue with dataset `SPring8_ADSC_SN916` being the only one requiring `FormatCBFFull`.
* Still need to test with `labelit`/`labelit_regression` once the test suites actually work
    * All except one labelit tests are now working. On NKS todo list to fix.


### `src/` layout for dxtbx
[`cctbx/dxtbx#382`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/382).
This is now affecting other people, [`dials/dials#1749`](https://github.com/dials/dials/issues/1749).
Currently waiting for the cctbx 2021.6 release.

Outcome:
- Check cctbx bootstrap, xfel builder Check phenix builder (needs `--cci-user`)
- Check dials bootstrap builder
- Barring extra problems happy to make this change
- Migration for libtbx entry point case in `libtbx_refresh.py`
- Will need a developer *'this is how you update your environment'* bulletin


### flumpy -- flex/numpy bridge
- [`cctbx/dxtbx#377`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/377)
- Tests blocked by [`cctbx/cctbx_project@ab8949`](https://github.com/cctbx/cctbx_project/commit/ab8949cd765dd31ef8749a5b5950459ffdf35c36) making it into release (cctbx v2021.6)
