    - **AB**: Run this against Xfel-regression tests: AB pls can you run this James?
    - ~~**ND**: Make test release using these branches~~
- Few more issues outstanding

- JBE not available today, defer to next meeting

### XFEL-Regression

  ```
  PackagesNotFoundError: The following packages are not available from current channels:

  - hdf5[version='<1.13.*']
  ```
