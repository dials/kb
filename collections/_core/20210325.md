# DIALS core meeting 2021-03-25

[![hackmd-github-sync-badge](https://hackmd.io/oqt1Jzg0TYqv-RVrmeUEdw/badge)](https://hackmd.io/oqt1Jzg0TYqv-RVrmeUEdw)


## Previous Actions

* [ ] MG: organise a [typing intro lecture](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20200917#typing-mypy), likely to happen in Q2.
* [ ] ND to set up a [`cbflib_adaptbx` pull request](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20201125#cbflib_adaptbx-dependency) for MAR detector fixes. Verify with `labelit_regression`.
* [x] ASB [to run tests on dxtbx#288 as per comment](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/288#issuecomment-769206024)
    * [x] DP to try and [generate a non-psana reproducer](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210225#construct-experiments-directly-rather-than-via-datablocks-288) for the issue found by ASB 
* [ ] [dx2 proposal](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210128#dx2-proposal)
	* [ ] MG to put in a PR to create a proposal in the proposal-space
    * [ ] MG+ND: Come up with a proposal to [move away from all code being in header files](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20201001#overall-architecture-discussion) and consolidate into a single library
* [ ] [Move to `hdf5plugin`](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210225#change-hdf5-plugin-library)
    * [ ] MG to [come up with a set of spells](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210225#change-hdf5-plugin-library) to use `hdf5plugin`
    * [ ] GW to [run a performance comparison](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210225#change-hdf5-plugin-library)
        * Provided an initial version of performance comparison code: https://gist.github.com/ndevenish/bf03b390adddb33089a8c6a70e8f4936 - we can run this with different plugins to assess whether there is any difference in run-time just paging through the data. 
    * [ ] Need to test that the conda-forge package isn't over-optimized [by running on `ws133`](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210225#change-hdf5-plugin-library)

## Agenda

### Discuss changes merged into cctbx [modify_cosym](https://github.com/cctbx/cctbx_project/commit/51d18a8d5783c2779d3afa17449663a505444d3a)
  - Hooking into cosym to do functionality, which was inadvertantly broken by code changes at Diamond
  - (Discussion about differences between Brehm/Diederichs and what Cosym is doing)
  - Limiting B/D to indexing ambiguity avoids problems with trying to match full sets of symmetry operators together


## Deferred to next meeting

### [cbflib conda-forge package](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20201125#cbflib-conda-forge-package)
  * [x] ASB to organise a side-meeting next to the HDRMX workshop
  * Discuss outcome from HDRMX meeting and next steps
  * What happes with cbflib maintenance in the future (previously: ASB to explore, but thought worth discussing again)

### [dxtbx#288](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/28) "Construct Experiments directly" post-merge outstanding issues

  - [dxtbx/#336](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/issues/336) - DataBlockFactory broken for single images
  - [dxtbx/#337](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/337) - adding XFAIL test for #336
