## Agenda


### PyCBF
- Version 0.9.6.5 now out
- Added more attribution in [`dials/pycbf@b8d4f6`](https://github.com/dials/pycbf/commit/b8d4f6ed47588a1145430f6fb53dbea9aec51e5d) and [`conda-forge/pycbf-feedstock#10`](https://github.com/conda-forge/pycbf-feedstock/pull/10)
- Now uses dials-data for testing data
- Added windows build: [`dials/pycbf#21`](https://github.com/dials/pycbf/pull/21) - somewhat scattered list of changes applied to CBFlib, at pycbf-build-time in [`002_windows.patch`](https://github.com/dials/pycbf/blob/56e99bafe9fded6d4a738febb943bf102d58b414/patches/002_windows.patch)
- Wheels live for multiple manylinux flavors, MacOS x86/arm, windows 64bit/32bit, for Pythons 3.6/3.7/3.8/3.9 live on pypi and, conda-forge mac/mac-arm/linux/windows 3.6/7/8/9/10.
- Can we close this item out for now?
    - Yes



### Contiguous Nexus

- [ ] "Contiguous Nexus" [`cctbx/dxtbx#356`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/356)
    - [ ] Non-draft state is pending checks against issues @dwpaley raised, and checking for non-contiguous cases [[prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210715#contiguous-nexus-pr)]
- AB wants this to be applied against new nexus writing
- RG: Probably useful to mock up an example in the nxmxtests
- **Action: Aaron** Reduce down zenodo dataset used in the issue ([`cctbx/dxtbx#93`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/issues/93))
 so that we can include it in dials-data.
- Afterward: Coordinate with RG to make sure the ideas in this are integrated into new nexus reading
- WIP - Dan has reduced to Six images - 300mb, wondering if this is enough. Discussion about what is required for the files and how small to absorb into the dials-data repository.

### DXTBX read-only base

- Issue [`cctbx/dxtbx#444`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/issues/444)
- Read only base by default would be the ideal
- Previously discussed downstream use cases and if DIALS needs to be included
    - PHENIX - depending on the readonly dxtbx stuff - until that is fixed DIALS will be pinned at 3.2 or similar. They also have a hard stop at Python 3.7, due to a slowly changing dependency. 
- Defer for two meetings - pinning on DIALS 3.2/virtualenv script working around for now
- Originally merged in, but turned out to be more involved 
- **Top Priority**
- Reopened under [`cctbx/dxtbx#511`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/511) - main change is regenerating dispatcher immediately during configuration, this mostly seems to work
- AB: going to run in next few days

### DIALS `src/` layout

- https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/2077
- Moves to the same `src/` based layout as dxtbx, xia2. This enables us to write a standard `setup.py` to actually install DIALS and it's entry points, like a normal python package. It also provides isolation against accidental namespace imports, namespace pollution.
- Once merged, will go through other open PRs (including draft) to update them the the new layout, though this isn't expected to be much of a problem.
- Uses the same mechanism as above dxtbx PR, e.g. regenerates the DIALS dispatchers once the environment is updated to properly recognise the package layout
- _Relies_ on [`dials/dials@cafaf4`](https://github.com/dials/dials/commit/cafaf4df9454b1a63cac2940322784d0ca020fc7) to force dials to configure before xfel, so that xfel picks up the correct locations
- Planning to merge this in over the next couple of weeks
### Circular XFEL dependency

- [`dials/dials#2076`](https://github.com/dials/dials/issues/2076) - xfel has crept up from optional to a hard dependency - `combine_experiments`, `cosym` and a few others use as unqualified imports
- Not sure how difficult it would be to resolve this and keep all functionality
- `stills_process`/`/indexing/nave_parameters.py` look reasonably dependent - might have to accept that these won't work outside a libtbx bootstrap.


### Dropping Data Blocks

https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/504

- [x] GW PR
 - [ ] After PR/PRs, ASB to contact e.g. Mike Wall about this, too. 
 - GW thinks reasonable to merge when these concerns addressed
 - Waiting on AB now, will get sorted as soon as can


### Still process
- Going to be a PR for "Diffbragg stage 1 refinement"
    - Uses pixel models of image to refine crystal using polychromotic spectra as per Mendez 2020 paper.
    - Implements an override in stills_process

ASB wants to put diffbrag stage 1 into dials.stills_process as a refinement engine. Depends on simtbx. This is very much dependent on GPU. Can use OMP etc.

- Derek Mendez going to send changes to Aaron
- more of a long term thing, drop until PR comes up

### Changes from XFEL sessions

- Dan: Image viewer: now support ellipses instead of just rings
- And can write out detector hierarchy file
    - Mentioned an issue with detector Z, DGW remembered a related-sounding issue https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/issues/472
- PRs incoming.
- Known orientations parts of stills_process needed to be rewritten to support this

### Ransac indexing
- Processing data using stills_process and crystfel, were getting more lattices than DIALS. 
- Crystfel uses alternative indexing programs (e.g. ND remembers compiling them specifically for users at DLS)
- "RANdom Subsampling And Consensus"
    - Index image 50 times, randomly subsetting the data
    - Cluster solutions
- In mid-feb implemented similar approach
    - Reduce data in small portions until failing/getting same answer
    - Still unresolved how to choose threshold for ending this
    - Much higher indexing rates! 25% more lattices, _and_ of higher quality


### Next meeting
Thursday, April 28th, 4pm UK (BST), 8am PDT.
