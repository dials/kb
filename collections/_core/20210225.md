# DIALS core meeting 2021-02-25

## Previous Actions

* [x] MG+ND: write a proposal for ['overall architecture discussion'](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20200903#overall-architecture-discussion) and ['new installer'](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20200903#new-installer)
* [ ] MG+ND: Come up with a proposal to [move away from all code being in header files](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20201001#overall-architecture-discussion) and consolidate into a single library
* [ ] MG: organise a [typing intro lecture](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20200917#typing-mypy), likely to happen in Q2.
* [ ] [cbflib conda-forge package](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20201125#cbflib-conda-forge-package)
    * [ ] ND to prepare an agenda for the HDRMX meeting in March
    * [ ] ASB to organise a side-meeting next to the HDRMX workshop
    * [ ] ASB to explore what should happen to cbflib maintenance in the future
* [ ] ND to set up a [`cbflib_adaptbx` pull request](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20201125#cbflib_adaptbx-dependency) for MAR detector fixes. Verify with `labelit_regression`.
* [ ] ASB [to run tests on dxtbx#288 as per comment](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/288#issuecomment-769206024)
* [x] [PR dials#1567](https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/1567)
	* [x] GW to [run tests and merge](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210128#drop-python-2-idioms-and-compatibility-fixes-dials1567) if passing
* [ ] [dx2 proposal](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210128#dx2-proposal)
	* [ ] MG to put in a PR to dx2 turning the readme to a proposal

## Agenda

### Construct Experiments directly rather than via DataBlocks [#288](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/288)

Can this be unblocked/merged?


### DC2: DIALS installer
ND and MG prepared a proposal ([DC2](https://dials.github.io/kb/proposals/dc2)) on how the installer should work in the future.


### Renaming `master` â†’ `main`
[xia2](https://github.com/xia2/xia2/) has now renamed its main branch.
[dials#1606](https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/1606) is ready to go in, dxtbx to follow


### End DIALS for Python 2
Should we upgrade the DIALS `UserWarning`
```python
if sys.version_info.major == 2:
    warnings.warn(
        "Python 2 is no longer supported. "
        "If you need Python 2.7 support please use the DIALS 2.2 release branch.",
        UserWarning,
    )
```
to a [xia2 hard stop](https://github.com/xia2/xia2/blob/main/src/xia2/__init__.py#L4)?
```python
if sys.version_info.major == 2:
    sys.exit("Python 2 is no longer supported")
```


### dxtbx comparator pseudo-classes
[dxtbx#302](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/302#issuecomment-778230823) found dxtbx comparator classes in `dxtbx.datablock`. These classes (`SequenceDiff`, `BeamDiff`, `ScanDiff`, `GoniometerDiff`, `DetectorDiff`) should really be functions. Given they are in datablock they could move to `dxtbx.model.experiment_list`, but possibly something like `dxtbx.model.compare` makes more sense?

(This is independent of [dxtbx#288](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/288) above)


### `dials.index`: create new experiments
`dials.index` should (or should not) create new experiments with crystals in rather than modifying in place existing experiments [as proposed in this issue (#1029)](https://github.com/dials/dials/issues/1029)

* Q: This would double the size of serial experiments?
* A: It wouldn't double the size, but increase the size slightly, and there are more pointers.
* The impact of this could be tested before work on this is done.

ASB ran this test during the meeting and added results to the ticket.
Results look favourable.

* Q: Is there any further objection to this if the performance impact isn't a blocked?
* A: No obvious objections. This could lead to downstream work needed to clean up afterwards.

Change in behaviour would only affect `dials.index` command line program, not the API call (thus not stills processing).

If `dials.index` gets a single experiment and can't find a lattice - should it write out the input file as is -- ie. not add a lattice, not reassign experiments, [#1080](https://github.com/dials/dials/issues/1080)? Sentiment is that it should definitely still terminate with a non-zero exitcode for scripting purposes. Writing out the input file means users may pass the file on to `dials.refine` and get hit with an even less informative error message.


### Next meeting
Thursday, February 25th, 4pm UK time, 8am PDT.
