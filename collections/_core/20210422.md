# DIALS core meeting 2021-04-22

[![hackmd-github-sync-badge](https://hackmd.io/N5MPuiqtQGyfdX4lCVerbg/badge)](https://hackmd.io/N5MPuiqtQGyfdX4lCVerbg)



## Previous Actions

* [ ] MG: organise a [typing intro lecture](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20200917#typing-mypy), likely to happen in Q2.
* [ ] ND to set up a [`cbflib_adaptbx` pull request](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20201125#cbflib_adaptbx-dependency) for MAR detector fixes. Verify with `labelit_regression`.
* [ ] [dx2 proposal](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210128#dx2-proposal)
	* [ ] MG to put in a PR to create a proposal in the proposal-space
    * [ ] MG+ND: Come up with a proposal to [move away from all code being in header files](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20201001#overall-architecture-discussion) and consolidate into a single library
* [ ] [Move to `hdf5plugin`](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210225#change-hdf5-plugin-library)
    * [ ] MG to [come up with a set of spells](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210225#change-hdf5-plugin-library) to use `hdf5plugin`
    * [ ] GW to [run a performance comparison](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210225#change-hdf5-plugin-library)
        * Provided an initial version of performance comparison code: https://gist.github.com/ndevenish/bf03b390adddb33089a8c6a70e8f4936 - we can run this with different plugins to assess whether there is any difference in run-time just paging through the data. 
    * [x] Need to test that the conda-forge package isn't over-optimized [by running on `ws133`](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210225#change-hdf5-plugin-library) -- MG: conda-forge package has AVX2 disabled.

## Agenda

### Discuss changes merged into cctbx [modify_cosym](https://github.com/cctbx/cctbx_project/commit/51d18a8d5783c2779d3afa17449663a505444d3a)
  - Hooking into cosym to do functionality, which was inadvertantly broken by [dials/dials#1647](https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/1647)
      - Several pull requests in flight to fix this
      - Main consequence is that reindexed datasets are not coloured any more
  - (Discussion about differences between Brehm/Diederichs and what Cosym is doing)
  - Limiting B/D to indexing ambiguity avoids problems with trying to match full sets of symmetry operators together

### Adding XFEL-regression to dials Azure tests
- Draft branch to add to Azure [here](https://github.com/dials/dials/compare/main...phyy-nx:xfel_azure)
- `linux_uncached_xfel` pipeline runs and passes
- Wants to make a PR to start having it better tested on dials repository
- AB: Observing timeout problems with some pipelines - would be good to check on main PR
- Discussions on what happens when downstream `xfel_regression` tests break - concerns that DIALS team would have no way to make these fixes go away
- MG: Perhaps the build time requirements would benefit from building on top of the conda-forge cctbx package instead of rebuilding every time
- Discussed running on PRs only instead of every push
- Conclusion: **Aaron to make pull request** for wider study and discussion


### [cbflib conda-forge package](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20201125#cbflib-conda-forge-package)
  * [x] ASB to organise a side-meeting next to the HDRMX workshop
  * What happes with cbflib maintenance in the future
  * Discussed outcome from HDRMX meeting and next steps
      * Changing so that tests pass on Debian downstream - this is an essential use case and new releases cannot break this
      * HB estimates graduate student project with approximately 3 months of effort required
  * Try current release - regenerate pycbf but leave old sources; and see if it works **Action: Nick to do testing this**
      * we could just release 0.9.6 on conda-forge with some light patching over the top if this works


## Deferred to next meeting

### [cctbx/dxtbx#288](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/288) "Construct Experiments directly" post-merge outstanding issues

  - [cctbx/dxtbx#336](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/issues/336) - DataBlockFactory broken for single images
  - XFAIL test for this now put in: [cctbx/dxtbx#337](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/337)



### Next meeting
Thursday, May 6th, 4pm UK (BST), 8am PDT.
