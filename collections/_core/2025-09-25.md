# DIALS core meeting 2025-09-25

## Previous Actions

- [ ] **ND** Investigate getting `psana` tests running on the DIALS xfel-regression testing
- [ ] **ND**: Move dials.diamond.ac.uk to a redirect to dials.github.io
- [x] **ND**: Action: Replace dials-support link with slack link/new mailing list address (not done by ND)

## Agenda

### DIALS Metrics on github.io
- Can play with the [power BI page](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZWQxYzQ3OGUtZGIwYS00NDZmLTk1YjctNDU1YmViNTI5ZDNjIiwidCI6IjM5NjU3M2NiLWYzNzgtNGI2OC05YmM4LTE1NzU1YzBjNTFmMyIsImMiOjZ9)
- Similar page for deposition incoming, by year / institute etc. - working out now how to integrate with the RST for dials.github.io pages.
- Discussed https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/3000
- With better title/extra newsfragment removed, not reason not to merge

### cctbx.github.io

- https://github.com/cctbx/cctbx.github.io
- was built by jenkins job
- been failing for ~1year with intersphinx errors
- is this a thing that cctbx still cares about/builds elsewhere?
- ND: Make issue and tag Aaron

### DIALS Office Hours
- 3pm Thursdays was what we talked about
- ND talk to JBE about running
- Make informal promise for office hours, and a slack channel that people can make known that they have a request to chat/for help about a particular topic
- JBE booked room, not sent out invites/ zoom yet - try to get done in next week.
    - [ ] Consider sending reminder to slack day before advertising
    - [ ] James to follow up with advert to non-Diamond people as it is happening already at DLS
- Graeme suggested "themes" for the office hours
- James to follow up

### Metrics
- 2025-09-25 - dxtbx-side merged in, nothing yet in DIALS side to push it into the mtz history https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/816
- Needs to be work to put in on DIALS side

## iota and Prime

- Both developers moved on
- Iota: trouble configuring on recent python versions
- DIALS pulls from conda-forge directly
    - This would be a solution for XFEL
- Prime easier to drop but defer decision
    - Aaron to ask Mona what she wants to do with Prime (still on to-do)

### dials.search_beam_position issues
- In discussion between Aaron and Marko
- Need to understand how to import the data to correctly represent this experiment
- Half of the raised issues resolved, the other half not sure how to address
- Now working for each detector in the experiment separately
- Non-integer results should be expected
- Aaron wants a true "per image, per image" to monitor beam centre drift, with a different detector model for each image (need to make sure this is the shape on import)
- Skip spot-free images
- 2025-09-25: Marko checked something in to do this, Aaron has yet to check

### AOAOB
- Hamburg: imageset, sequences, laziness so it works on 100,000 image HDF5 files
- Want Graeme, David to be here, defer

### Dials data download failures

- CI failing due to data downloads
- Does dials-data retry?
- ND has recollection that DGW was looking at this?
- Possibly more agressive retention of caches?
- Moved DGW to admin to allow to bypass failures due to incorrect download
- Possibly: Need to check status code on file download?

## AOB

### Pycbf missing from cbflib repository
- Removed because regenerated
- Discussed multiple options, including:
  - Putting back in cbflib
  - Using cbflib from conda-forge
  - Just pinning


### Next meeting

Thursday, October 9th, 4pm (BST), 8am (PDT), 10am (CDT)
