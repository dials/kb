## Agenda


### NX Writer! ([prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/2023-05-04#nx-writer-prev), [prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/2023-03-09#aob))

 - https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/615
- Dependent on [dxtbx#612 "Multidimensional Images"](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/612)
    - Richard added basic test case -> **Aaron** is ok?

### Removing circular xfel dependencies with serialtbx

- Set of PRs to implement
    - CCTBX: https://github.com/cctbx/cctbx_project/pull/872 - contains descriptions of all changes made
    - dxtbx: https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/627
    - dials: https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/2404
    - iota: https://github.com/ssrl-px/iota/pull/5
    - xfel_regression https://gitlab.com/cctbx/xfel_regression/-/merge_requests/10
- We all need to look at things
    - Schedule some time next week at DLS to look over these PRs
- ND reviewed, looks OK ~~, please can we hold off from merging until the dust settles from scan and polybeam changes.~~
- ASB happy for this to hold off a couple weeks for non-technical reasons

### NXMX
- Discussion about dynamic masking in NXmx.
- Defer until DP back, recollection on this discussion is fuzzy
- Possibly:
    - https://github.com/dials/nxmx/pull/17
    - https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/629
- [x] Action: RG to have look at
    - [ ] Suggested alternate NXmx change https://github.com/dials/nxmx/pull/21
- Discussion concluding that "Static" is probably okay for "Precaculated" masks, even if it changes from frame-to-frame, and "Dynamic" would imply calculated at anaylsis.
- General agreement that this is fine, as long as we clarify the meaning of static on the function docstring
- https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/blob/842d45939160d47829e03776a98f671f15ae16a2/src/dxtbx/format/FormatMultiImage.py#L17
- Discussed motivations, AB & DP going to go back and validate that it fulfills the requirements of the data processing that was intended by these changes
- Re-address when ready for submission again

### xia2.multiplex fails because "Duplicate batch offsets detected"
- Longstanding (>3 years) issue: https://github.com/xia2/xia2/issues/430
- Now getting reports from real user data
- Potential solution suggested to never share Scan objects [cctbx/dxtbx#152](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/issues/152)
- [ ] implement non-sharing of Scan objects - no logic for doing so, since readonly?
- [ ] **JBE**: Do this

### Imageset slicing broken
- https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/issues/633
- Fix now ready at https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/634 and https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/2411
- Anyone else want to look?
- When merged, will require reversion of changes to azure-pipelines YML files to checkout specific dxtbx branch
- [ ] DGW thinks this one can be merged without contention - needs sync'd repo merge
- [ ] rebase this branch on top of Scans branch & run tests
- [ ] Tie off loose ends and merge internally
- [ ] **ND** Merge tomorrow


### bit_depth_imageset
- Forthcoming NIAC meeting, GW proposal to add should pass
- Pragmatism!
- Current Nexus code camp: To be discussed and hopefully agreed this week

## AOB?

- CHESS SSX Workshop upcoming https://indico.classe.cornell.edu/event/2248/overview

- Aaron Finke was asking Graeme if we had considered how to address the memory requirement issues.
    - ND: Don't think you could refactor, think would need to re-approach the problem
    - AB: New grant application mentions this issue, would potentially have resources to assign people to the problem
