# DIALS core meeting 2023-08-10


## Previous Actions

- [ ] **ND**: PR to remove `std::string` support for messagepack from dials code
- [ ] **ND** Investigate getting `psana` tests running on the DIALS xfel-regression testing
- [ ] Dropping Data Blocks (~~[#504](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/504)~~ [#570](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/570))
    - [ ] **ND**: Look at DIALS failures and work out what needs to be migrated
    - [x] Has been movement as DGW started investigating: https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/2465
- [x] **AB**: Check test case on Multidimensional Images [dxtbx#612](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/612) is reasonable
- [ ] **DP**: Add msgpack "hot" path to include environment in cctbx ([prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/2023-05-04#msgpack-httpsgithubcomdialsdialspull2409))
    - [ ] Work in https://github.com/cctbx/cctbx_project/commit/03a9a6797044126984a69ff30d00be6df408e43a, pending approval/merge
- [ ] [not until august at least] **JBE:** Solve  "multiplex: Duplicate Batch offsets detected" [xia2#430](https://github.com/xia2/xia2/issues/430) ([prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/2023-06-15#xia2multiplex-fails-because-duplicate-batch-offsets-detected))
- [x] **AB**: Check if RG test cases on [dxtbx#612 "Multidimensional Images"](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/612) are appropriate
    - [x] A dependency of [dxtbx#615 NX Writer](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/615) ([prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/2023-06-15#nx-writer-prev-prev)) so promote this to agenda again when done
- **AB**: Moving forward serialtbx changes ([prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/2023-06-15#removing-circular-xfel-dependencies-with-serialtbx)). [cctbx#872](https://github.com/cctbx/cctbx_project/pull/872) seems immediate blocker. 
- [x] **ND**: Look at dials-support "Error importing .cbf files using DIALS"
- [ ] **ND** or **DW**: Cannot view reciprocal lattice using dials.reciprocal_lattice_viewer [#2443](https://github.com/dials/dials/issues/2443)
    - Probably needs someone to dig into windows gltbx behaviour, or at least work out where issue lies


## Agenda

### NXMX multimensional images
- Now ready to merge

### NX Writer
- Ready for (re-)review
- People look over again
- Run manual, separate testing against DIALS
- Nick to fixup commit and merge tomorrow

### dials.stills_process refactor
- Made much more efficient when having mixed image sizes so that each rank doesn't need to do all the import itself

### Removing XFEL dependency from DIALS
- [dials#2390](https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/2390)
- We'd like to talk about merging this, and then re-removing once serialtbx is ready
    - Agreed, revert will go at top of serialtbx
    - Serialtbx may be ready very soon!!!!

### DIALS-support "Error importing .cbf files using DIALS"
- [dials#2488](https://github.com/dials/dials/issues/2488)
-  Pilatus3 1M at BL02B1, SPRING-8 appears to be transposed!!??!?
-  Looks too complicated to solve easily, wondering if anyone experienced
- Graeme going to chat to Kunio Hirata



### dials.cosym finds the right operator but puts it wrongly
- [dials#2486](https://github.com/dials/dials/issues/2486)
- DP will try to have a look on Monday

## AOB?

### Small Cell!
- https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/2477
- `cctbx.xfel.small_cell_process` currently discards dials indexer
    - lots of things that the dials-index pipeline needs isn't done
    - Been working on: dials.stills_process work instead, using DGW small-cell indexer
    - Works well - possibly making `small_cell_process` redundant
    - Lots of ongoing discussion


### Next meeting

Thursday, August 24th, 4pm (BST), 8am (PDT)
