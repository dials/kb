[Previous meeting: [2021-08-26](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210826)]


## Previous Actions

* [ ] ND: conda-forge pycbf: Make new release to use dials-data directly for tests
- [ ] "Contiguous Nexus" [`cctbx/dxtbx#356`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/356)
    - [ ] Non-draft state is pending checks against issues @dwpaley raised, and checking for non-contiguous cases [[prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210715#contiguous-nexus-pr)]
- [ ] dxtbx `src/` layout [[prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210715#src-layout-for-dxtbx)]
    - [ ] Nick: Ask cctbxbb if anyone has knowledge or experience of re-export of dispatchers on windows
    - [ ] This is a higher priority now - David feeling pain of missing
- [ ] Removal of DataBlock [[prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210826#removal-of-datablock)]
    - [ ] Make a longer-term DC for migration over ~6 month period
    - [ ] Used in tests, documentation
    - [ ] Possibly heavily used by 2020 LS49 paper
- [X] CCTBX Occasional failure of mirror job
    - [X] [`cctbx/cctbx_project#646`](https://github.com/cctbx/cctbx_project/pull/646)
- [X] DIALS: Remove old environment conda files: [`dials/dials#1865`](https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/1865)
- DXTBX/pycbf [[prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210826#cbflib-conda-forge-packagepycbf)]
    - Outstanding: [`dxtbx#368`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/368) for optional cbflib/_adaptbx .
    * [ ] Last status: one `labelit`/`labelit_regression` test still doesn't pass
    * All except one labelit tests are now working. On NKS todo list to fix.
    * Progress on CBFlib 0.9.7?


## Agenda

### Datablock
- Graeme asks how hard to remove and whether we should just allocate a block of time
- (Possibly heavily used by 2020 LS49 paper)
    - Dan thinks that it's described more than used
- Discussion on approach of doing this work
    - More visible deprecationwarning
    - Impact assessment and see who/what code is affected
    - Actual removal probably not too difficult

### Nonconventional P1 indexing
- [`dials/dials#1878`](https://github.com/dials/dials/issues/1878)
- XFail test in [`dials/dials@9b4369`](https://github.com/dials/dials/commit/9b436918a175995b4c857040da94ed26ac94007d)
- GW: Perhaps we need to take what the user gives us, map into standard setting and remember that reindex so that it can invert the reindexing at the end
- DW: Has encountered this problem, needs to manually reindex back to the setting that he wanted
- GW: Another example of comparing unit cells in a setting that is more convenient for comparisons
- Discussion over, _should_ we do this - an argument for always returning in standard setting and relying on user to transform it back if they _really_ want that
- Discussion seems to be concluding that returning in user-specified order probably makes sense
    - Not doing so has XFEL gui repercussions
    - It already effectively does this for non-P1 cells
    - **Action:** Richard going to have a look to see how hard this is to do

### ~~dxtbx~~ `src/` layout

- dxtbx and xia2 were both fixed for read-only install
- xia also had the offline issue
    - Fixed in [`xia2/xia2@a809cd`](https://github.com/xia2/xia2/commit/a809cd22642e63838e2c4f039f9883f15d8e14d6)
    - Deployed in DIALS 3.6.1

### Deterministic Experiment Identifiers

- PR: [`dials/dials#1864`](https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/1864)
- GW: It would be useful to describe the problem that is trying to be solved
- ND: (again) bring up - would a general metadata field that can have an `ast.literal_eval` dictionary embedded solve this problem?
    - DP: Yes, this would seem to solve the issue
- Matching up multiple lattices based on image/lattice count
    - Is this reproduceable - getting the same N lattices doesn't mean that they are in the same order
    - GitHub discussion possibly worthwhile for both of these

### Next meeting
Thursday, September 23rd, 4pm UK (BST), 8am PDT.
