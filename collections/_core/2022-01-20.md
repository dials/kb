## Previous Actions

- [ ] dxtbx `src/` layout [[prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210715#src-layout-for-dxtbx)]
    - [ ] Nick: Outstanding issues with dispatcher re-export on windows
    - [ ] This is a higher priority now - David feeling pain of missing
    - [ ] Also, seeing related errors "in the wild
    - [ ] Nick: **Action before 3.9**
- [ ] Removal of DataBlock [[prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210909#datablock), [prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210826#removal-of-datablock)]
    - [x] **Nick:** More visible deprecationwarning ([`cctbx/dxtbx#448`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/448))
    - Merged 23rd November. Do we want to set any plans for further?
    - [ ] **Action: GW** Make a PR/branch to remove this so that we can run things against it
- DXTBX/pycbf [[prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210826#cbflib-conda-forge-packagepycbf)]
    - ~[`dxtbx#368`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/368) for optional cbflib/_adaptbx .~~ Merged.
    * [ ] ND: conda-forge pycbf: Make new release to use dials-data directly for tests
    * [ ] Nick: Add lots more attribution
    * [ ] `dxtbx`: Now 3.8.0 our can move forwards [`conda-forge/staged-recipes#16846`](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/16846)
- [ ] Deterministic Experiment Identifiers [[prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210923#deterministic-experiment-identifiers)]
    - [x] **Aaron:** Change `dials.stills_process` to default to composite mode and not write experiment files
    - [x] **GW/Aaron**: Organise another meeting to go over ["load before heat death"](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/118) PR and reasons why, solutions etc
    - [ ] Not going to treat now, will go back to in new year and re-evaluate if required
        - Sounds plausibly possible to fix without this PR
        - **Nick: Close for now**, alternative approach will be tried, if that doesn't work we will reopen
- [ ] Nick: Make sure that HKLviewer ([prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20211209#new-item-hklviewer)) works at Diamond on `module load`
- [x] ImageSet/ImageSetData memory usage - ~~[`cctbx/dxtbx#438`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/438)~~ merged
