# DIALS core meeting 2020-08-11

[![hackmd-github-sync-badge](https://hackmd.io/WASunvTEQHScXh-zzoSAsQ/badge)](https://hackmd.io/WASunvTEQHScXh-zzoSAsQ)


## Previous Actions

* [ ] ND: rewrite contribution guidelines (as PR) to include towncrier/newsfragments
* [x] GW: write comment on [dials#1327](https://github.com/dials/dials/issues/1327)
* [x] MG: fix xia2 issues re. Python 3.8 ([xia2#510](https://github.com/xia2/xia2/pull/510))

## Agenda
1.	Python 3.6 deprecation proposal / [NEP-29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html) / [dials#1327](https://github.com/dials/dials/issues/1327)
    * We will follow 1327
    * GW wrote comment on issue
    * Item can be removed from agenda? Probably worth documenting outcome in the `/kb` repository
2.	Moving to Python 3.8 as the next default, skipping 3.7 (cf. [#1328-comment](https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/1328#issuecomment-655812577))
    * Development platform is independent of supported versions. Those will include conda-forge-supported versions at the minimum.
    * xia2 currently has issues with 3.8
        * these have now been resolved ([xia2#510](https://github.com/xia2/xia2/pull/510))
3.	Overall architecture discussion - full conda or alternatives?
    * move from libtbx dispatchers to normal python dispatchers
    * allow regular python commands access to the libtbx-modules namespaces
    * bigger issue, needs more discussion and figuring out how to do this and how to migrate
4.	Following from that: How should a new installer look like
5.  Open up these DIALS core meetings to DIALS-W and the world in an effort to [move DIALS towards a stage 3 project](http:/urssi.us/blog/2019/02/25/software-incubator-workshop-a-synthesis/)
    * [x] Invite to meetings in dials-support and gitter
    * [ ] Change time to later in the day
    * [x] Make meeting minutes public
    * Item can be removed from agenda?
6.  DIALS master stable / [dials#1353](https://github.com/dials/dials/issues/1353)
    * Currently evaluating on xia2 (1 month = 24th of August)
    * How would we distinguish with pull requests that should be reviewed and pull requests that can be merged as soon as the tests have passed?
        * MG: labels may be an option? GitHub plans to introduce an auto-merge feature for pull requests later this year. We could probably do this right now using github actions.
        * GW: pull requests can be moved to draft status to express "hang fire, I would like to look at"
    * Fundamentally it's possible that tests fail because of an upstream repository change (eg. cctbx/scitbx/constants breaking xia2)
        * May have to monitor this. This could be resolved by using semantically versioned upstream releases (for cctbx_project) and stable build mechanism (for dxtbx) but comes with other drawbacks.
7. Typing
    * Options:
        * [mypy pre-commit, mypy action (#1357)](https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/1357)
        * [pytype action (#1364)](https://github.com/dials/dials/issues/1364)
    * What do we want to do?
8. Any other business
