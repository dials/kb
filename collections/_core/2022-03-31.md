- [x] (*) DXTBX/pycbf [[prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210826#cbflib-conda-forge-packagepycbf)]
    * [x] ND: conda-forge pycbf: Make new release to use dials-data directly for tests
    * [x] Nick: Add lots more attribution
- [ ] (*) Nick: dxtbx and read-only base

## Agenda


### Dropping Data Blocks

https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/504

- [x] GW PR
 - [ ] After PR/PRs, ASB to contact e.g. Mike Wall about this, too. 
 - GW thinks reasonable to merge when these concerns addressed


### Still process
- Going to be a PR for "Diffbragg stage 1 refinement"
    - Uses pixel models of image to refine crystal using polychromotic spectra as per Mendez 2020 paper.
    - Implements an override in stills_process

ASB wants to put diffbrag stage 1 into dials.stills_process as a refinement engine. Depends on simtbx. This is very much dependent on GPU. Can use OMP etc.

- Derek Mendez going to send changes to Aaron


### Add known_orientations to dials.stills_process

https://github.com/dials/dials/commit/eb7967fbd4be133b6f631af2ac14ac5e2697bca2

### Pathlib changes

https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/2038

- Expecting this to be ready soon
- Is a big pull request
- Send out notice
- **Action**: GW to send out notice to dials-support

## Deferred to next meeting


### PyCBF
- Version 0.9.6.5 now out
- Added more attribution in [`dials/pycbf@b8d4f6`](https://github.com/dials/pycbf/commit/b8d4f6ed47588a1145430f6fb53dbea9aec51e5d) and [`conda-forge/pycbf-feedstock#10`](https://github.com/conda-forge/pycbf-feedstock/pull/10)
- Now uses dials-data for testing data
- Added windows build: [`dials/pycbf#21`](https://github.com/dials/pycbf/pull/21) - somewhat scattered list of changes applied to CBFlib, at pycbf-build-time in [`002_windows.patch`](https://github.com/dials/pycbf/blob/56e99bafe9fded6d4a738febb943bf102d58b414/patches/002_windows.patch)
- Wheels live for multiple manylinux flavors, MacOS x86/arm, windows 64bit/32bit, for Pythons 3.6/3.7/3.8/3.9 live on pypi and, conda-forge mac/mac-arm/linux/windows 3.6/7/8/9/10.


### DXTBX read-only base

- Read only base by default would be the ideal
- Turned out to be more involved
- Previously discussed downstream use cases and if DIALS needs to be included
    - PHENIX - depending on the readonly dxtbx stuff - until that is fixed DIALS will be pinned at 3.2 or similar. They also have a hard stop at Python 3.7, due to a slowly changing dependency. 
- Defer for two meetings - pinning on DIALS 3.2/virtualenv script working around for now
- Issue [`cctbx/dxtbx#444`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/issues/444)
- **Top Priority**

### Contiguous Nexus

- [ ] "Contiguous Nexus" [`cctbx/dxtbx#356`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/pull/356)
    - [ ] Non-draft state is pending checks against issues @dwpaley raised, and checking for non-contiguous cases [[prev](https://dials.github.io/kb/core/20210715#contiguous-nexus-pr)]
- AB wants this to be applied against new nexus writing
- RG: Probably useful to mock up an example in the nxmxtests
- **Action: Aaron** Reduce down zenodo dataset used in the issue ([`cctbx/dxtbx#93`](https://github.com/cctbx/dxtbx/issues/93))
 so that we can include it in dials-data.
- Afterward: Coordinate with RG to make sure the ideas in this are integrated into new nexus reading


### Next meeting
Thursday, April 14th, 4pm UK (BST), 8am PDT.
