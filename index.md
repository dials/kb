## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/dials/kb/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
For more details on that file format see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Howtos

We have a set of howtos:
{% for howto in site.howtos %}
- [{{ howto.name }}]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ howto.url }})
{% endfor %}

### Meeting minutes

{% for meeting in site.meetings %}
- [{{ meeting.name }}]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ meeting.url }})
{% endfor %}

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/dials/kb/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
